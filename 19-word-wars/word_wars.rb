# Word Enemies
# Words are going into battle, hurling letters from one to the other. Your
# method called `battle` should take in two words (strings) as arguments. The
# letters that are the same in each word cancel each other out. The remaining
# letters have the value of their position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2..). The word
# with the highest value wins!
# Return which word won the war
# You can assume that the two inputs will be valid, lowercase, non empty strings
# and that there will be no ties.
