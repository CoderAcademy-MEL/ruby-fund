## Introduction

These are a set of ruby challenges that are relate to the core concepts we're learning. Some of the questions are really tricky; not every single question needs to be completed. It's all practice!

## Tools

We'll be using a tool called `rspec` to verify that you're solving the challenges correctly.

To install `rspec` run:

```bash 
gem install rspec
```

The challenges are all nested in their own directory. The challenge requirements and where you'll actually write your solution is in `index.rb`. The test file is under `tests.rb`. You can look at this `tests` file but don't edit it.

Read the requirements and then run the tests straight away to see what's failing. 

## Instructions

### To Get Access To Challenges and Using Git and GitHub

To get access to these challenge you'll be using a tool called git locally on your computers.

This will allow you to connect to a remote tool called GitHub and also to work in an isolated branch to avoid conflicts if teachers are to post any changes.

This will be the process you need to follow to get the challenges.

1. Ensure you have a GitHub account https://github.com/ 

2. `cd` into the particular directory where you want all of these challenges to be, inside the `coder-academy` directory should be fine

3. Run this command from the command line `git clone https://github.com/CoderAcademy-MEL/ruby-fund.git` to get the code files and tests, you'll need to enter your Github username and password

4. Change to the working space (or branch) needed to solve your challenges in order to avoid any conflicts `git checkout -b solutions`

5. Verify that you're the solutions branch with `git branch` before you start working, make sure you do this every time you try to solve these challenges

### To Solve the Challenges and Run Tests

This will be the process you need to follow for the first question.

1. Change into the directory with the specific challenge

From the command line:

```bash
cd 01-winner-predictor
rspec tests.rb
```

The `rspec` command executes the `tests.rb` file tells you what code needs to be written in order to satisfy the test implementation. The `.rspec` file is just a set of options to make rspec print to terminal in a helpful way.

2. Write the code to solve the test

3. Run the `rspec tests.rb` command again to see if your code passed

4. I find it helpful to just execute the normal ruby file (no rspec) whilst I'm working through a technical challenge

From the command line:

```bash
ruby index.rb
```

5. Have fun ðŸ§
