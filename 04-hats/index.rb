# This problem is tough, but fun. Come back to this challenge if you are spending too much time on it.

# 100 students are sitting in a row, and each has a hat on. Their strange teacher (who is probably mad as a hatter from trying to teach 100 students) walks along the line of students (starting from the same end each time). The first time he takes every hat off. On the second pass he toggles the state of every second hat (putting on if off, taking off if on), changing the ‘hat state’ of every even numbered student. The third pass he toggles every third hat. The fourth every fourth, and the fifth every fifth, and so on until he has passed the students 100 times. What is the final state of the hats (ie, which students have a hat on or off)?

# Write a method called the_hats_problem which contains your logic and returns the result. The result should be an array of strings containing 0's (hats off) and 1's (hats on).
