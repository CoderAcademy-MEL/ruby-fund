# In this challenge you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

# Create a method called high_low that takes a single argument, a string of space separated numbers eg. '2 4 5'
# All numbers in the string are valid Integers, and can be positive or negative.
# There will always be at least one number in the input string.
# The Output should be a String.
# The Output should be structured as the high number a space and the low number
# e.g. high_low('1 2 -3 4 5') => '5 -3'
