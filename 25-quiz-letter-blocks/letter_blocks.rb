# *Quiz Letter blocks*
# You are given a collection of ABC blocks. Just like the ones you had when you
# were a kid. There are twenty blocks with two letters on each block. You are
# guaranteed to have a complete alphabet amongst all sides of the blocks. The
# sample blocks are:
# [['B','O'],
# ['X','K'],
# ['D','Q'],
# ['C','P'],
# ['N','A'],
# ['G','T'],
# ['R','E'],
# ['T','G'],
# ['Q','D'],
# ['F','S'],
# ['J','W'],
# ['H','U'],
# ['V','I'],
# ['A','N'],
# ['E','R'],
# ['F','S'],
# ['L','Y'],
# ['P','C'],
# ['Z','M']]

# Write a method called can_make_word that takes the 'blocks' and a potential
# word as inputs. the method will return true if the word can be make or false
# if not. Check the tests.rb file for words that can be make and words that can
# not be made.
