# *Word Enemies*
# Words are going into battle, hurling letters from one to the other. Your function takes in two words (strings) as arguments. The letters that are the same in each word cancel each other out. The letters have the value of their position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2..)
# Output which word won the war.
