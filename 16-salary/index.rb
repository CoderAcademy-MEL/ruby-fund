require_relative "../13-tax/index"

# Write a method that asks the user for a salary (as number), and a percentage. The percentage will be a guess by the person as to how much tax is paid on a certain salary.

# Using the tax question (problem 13), return a hash of the guess, the actual percentage, and the difference between the two (a three key hash). Write to screen each of these in a readable format. (You might consider cleaning the user input as a small extension.)
