# Write a method called tax_difference that takes in a salary and a percentage_guess (both as integers). The percentage will be a guess by the person as to how much tax is paid on a certain salary.

# Using the tax question (problem 13), return a hash of the guess, the actual percentage, and the difference between the two (a three key hash). Make sure the difference is a positive number.

# As an advanced challenge make the tax_difference method take no arguments and instead take the salary and the percentage_guess as user input. Validate this input to ensure you only get valid integers. If the input is wrong make the user type in a new value.
