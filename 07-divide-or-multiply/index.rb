# Divide and conquer? No, divide or multiply!

# Define a method called true_or_false that takes one argument and returns true if that argument is even, and false if the argument is an odd number.

# Define a method called div_or_mult_two which takes a number as an argument. This method will determine whether the argument is an even or odd number by calling the previous method. The argument is then divided by 2 if it is even, or multiplied by 2 if it is odd. Return the result from the method.
