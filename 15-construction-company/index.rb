# You are the dodgy head of a construction company. You jam in the most number of apartments per floor that regulations will allow. 

# You write one method that calculates the area of floorspace from two arguments, the length and width. 

# You write a second method that takes a floorspace, and calculates the number of apartments you can fit within this given area (you can fit one apartment in every 28 square meters, and this should be rounded down - you canâ€™t have a partial apartment). 
# Write a third method that takes a number of floors, a length, and a width as arguments, and that returns a hash of the total number of apartments you can jam into the building, and the total money made (assuming each apartment is worth $120,000) using the previous two methods.
