# In this challenge we will practice calling methods. We will start with one number which is processed through multiple methods to return the 'mangled' number.

# Define a method called five_times which takes a number as an argument and returns the value that results when the argument is multiplied by 5. 

# Define a method called hund_times which takes a number as an argument and returns the result of that argument being multiplied by 100. 

# Define a method div_seven which takes a number as an argument and returns the result of that argument divided by 7.

# Define a method called number_mangle which takes a number as an argument and which uses only the previously defined methods to multiply that argument by 5, then multiple the result by 100, and then divide the result by 7.  Return the result.
