# Using the stations below from the HK Metro, write a method that takes one
# argument, a hash within which there are three keys: two which are strings (an
# origin station and a destination station), and one which is an array.
# The hash should be formatted as:
# {
#   origin: 'a string',
#   destination: 'a string',
#   stations: [] The stations array below
# }
# The method should return an array that contains all the stations between the
# origin and the destination, including the origin and destination stations.
# For example :
# if the origin was 'Fan Ling' and the destination was 'Tai Po Market' and the
# stations are the array below. Then the method should return
# => ['Fan Ling', 'Tai Wo', 'Tai Po Market']

# Run the tests to see the other edge cases.

# Use these stations for testing your code, these are the same ones used in
# the test file.

# stations = [
#   'Lok Ma Chau',
#   'Sheung Shui',
#   'Fanling',
#   'Tai Wo',
#   'Tai Po Market',
#   'University',
#   'Fo Tan',
#   'Sha Tin',
#   'Tai Wai',
#   'Kowloon Tong',
#   'Mong Kok East',
#   'Hung Hom'
# ]
