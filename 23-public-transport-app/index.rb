# Using some of the features in the past couple of problems, start turning your code into a basic PTV app (like our public transport app, if you aren't familiar). Use any train system you like as the basis for this.
# I'm happy to give hints, or you can get together and help each other. You need to simplify things, so only dummy up one or at most two lines at first (or at last). 
# The final product (coded, or just pseudo-coded) would take a user input of an origin station, and a destination station, and give the stations that the journey would pass through, including all train line changes. (There is no need for times - although if you feel like an extension I can give a modified version that you could work on.)
# Start with one train line, represented by an array. If you extend it to two lines, you need to think about how to represent the lines as data, and this might be a complex object. Think through all the options. You will need some way to carry the user data through the method/s, and some way to represent the train system. You will likely need several small methods, and will likely have to employ a full range of data types, such as hashes and arrays (and possibly arrays of arrays). 
# I am more than happy to help out anyone stuck, particularly if they have a specific question where they are stuck, and have thought about it. I'm also happy to look through code people would like examined.
