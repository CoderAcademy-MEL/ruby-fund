# Let's play with arrays!

# Define an array with three numbers in it.

# Write a method called array_multiplier that takes two arguments. The first argument will be an array. The second will be a number. The method returns the array resulting from each element in the array being multiplied by the second argument. Return the result.

# Call this function with your array and an argument of your choice, and store the result in a well-named variable.
